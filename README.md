# CSC210EXAM

Please view FINALEXAM.pdf to look at the details of the exam.

This was an exam I had to take in order to get credit for the beginner courses of Computer Science at SFSU. Despite passing the AP Exam with a 3, I needed to pass the exam with a 4. To get credit, I was given the option to do this exam.

NOTE: There are many solutions to the exam. My implementation was how I interpreted the requirements. When taking the exam, you were supposed to be given starter code (a skeleton structure of the program) in a zip file, but I only received the pdf file. As such, I had to build the program from the ground up with more creative implementations of how to pass the exam; I had more freedom which may lead to solutions that weren't intended. I do not have the zip file to share either. If you plan on trying to take this exam as a "mock exam", I encourage you to not look at my solution and try it yourself first.
